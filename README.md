TechShare is a windows application that allows you and your friends to share files without using external file servers, like google drive.

## Advantages of directly sending files

- Unlimited File Sizes (as long as the sender and receiver have enough space to fit the file)
- Much Faster Download Speeds
- No uploading delay (your pc acts like the file server)


## Disadvantages of directly sending files

- Have to start the app everytime you need to send files (or leave the app open which is NOT RECOMMENDED)
- Have to share your ip to the receiver (except if you use playit.gg)
## To Do:

- Make v1.0 (make it functional)
- Built-in playit.gg support
- Easier to use 
- UI interface (not sure)
- Remote Control of File Server (from other computers, phones)
